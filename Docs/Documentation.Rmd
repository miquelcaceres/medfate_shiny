The package installation includes a number of *vignettes* that illustrate how to run simulation models in **medfate**. Vignettes and documentation of package functions can also be read at the  [GitHub pages site](https://miquelcaceres.github.io/medfate/) of the package.

The [medfate reference book](https://miquelcaceres.github.io/medfate/medfatebook/) provides full documentation regarding the design and formulation of models included in the package.

An interactive example application showing the behaviour of the water balance model can be found in this site, under the tab `Example tab`.
