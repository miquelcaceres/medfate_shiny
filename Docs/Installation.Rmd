Package `medfate` can be found at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), where we update versions every few months. Users can also download and install the latest stable versions GitHub as follows:

`devtools::install_github("miquelcaceres/medfate")`

Required packages `devtools` and `curl` may be installed/updated first. Documentation on the models included in `medfate` and how to run them using the package functions can be found below. Additionally, users can have help to run package functions directly as package vignettes, by forcing their inclusion in installation: 

`devtools::install_github("miquelcaceres/medfate", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"))`
